        <h1>My Special Code</h1>
        
        <p>Coding has been a great adventure for me because of all the creativity I can bring into this virtual universe of mine. With the code I have here, I decided to find 3 new ways to customize my work. Here, I used the css polygon() function, opacity() function, invert() function, and the position property.</p>
